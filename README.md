## üìñ Overview

- **Agent Laboratory** is an end-to-end autonomous research workflow meant to assist **you** as the human researcher toward **implementing your research ideas**. Agent Laboratory consists of specialized agents driven by large language models to support you through the entire research workflow‚Äîfrom conducting literature reviews and formulating plans to executing experiments and writing comprehensive reports. 
- This system is not designed to replace your creativity but to complement it, enabling you to focus on ideation and critical thinking while automating repetitive and time-intensive tasks like coding and documentation. By accommodating varying levels of computational resources and human involvement, Agent Laboratory aims to accelerate scientific discovery and optimize your research productivity.

### üî¨ How does Agent Laboratory work?

- Agent Laboratory consists of three primary phases that systematically guide the research process: (1) Literature Review, (2) Experimentation, and (3) Report Writing. During each phase, specialized agents driven by LLMs collaborate to accomplish distinct objectives, integrating external tools like arXiv, Hugging Face, Python, and LaTeX to optimize outcomes. This structured workflow begins with the independent collection and analysis of relevant research papers, progresses through collaborative planning and data preparation, and results in automated experimentation and comprehensive report generation. Details on specific agent roles and their contributions across these phases are discussed in the paper.

### üëæ Currently supported models

* **OpenAI**: o1, o1-preview, o1-mini, gpt-4o
* **DeepSeek**: deepseek-chat (deepseek-v3)

To select a specific llm set the flag `--llm-backend="llm_model"` for example `--llm-backend="gpt-4o"` or `--llm-backend="deepseek-chat"`. Please feel free to add a PR supporting new models according to your need!

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:SamuelSchmidgall/AgentLaboratory.git
cd AgentLaboratory

# 2. Create output directory
mkdir output

# 3. Build Docker image (choose one):
# Option A: Minimal build (faster, no LaTeX support)
docker build -f Dockerfile.minimal -t agent-laboratory .

# Option B: Full build (slower, includes LaTeX support)
docker build -t agent-laboratory .

# Build Time Comparison:
# Minimal: ~5-10 minutes
# Full: ~20-30 minutes (includes LaTeX packages)

# 4. Run the container
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key" \
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_key" \
  agent-laboratory \
  --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" \
  --research-topic "Your research topic"
```

For Windows Command Prompt:
```cmd
:: After cloning and cd into directory
mkdir output
docker build -t agent-laboratory .
docker run -it --rm -v "%CD%/output:/output" -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key" -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_key" agent-laboratory --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" --research-topic "Your research topic"
```

### Docker Setup Details

The Docker setup provides a consistent environment across different machines and eliminates the need to install Python and dependencies directly on your host system.

1. **Build the Docker image**:
```bash
docker build -t agent-laboratory .
```

2. **Run the container**:

Linux/macOS:
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key" \
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_key" \
  agent-laboratory \
  --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" \
  --research-topic "Your research topic here"
```

Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
docker run -it --rm -v "%CD%/output:/output" -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key" -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_key" agent-laboratory --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" --research-topic "Your research topic here"
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
docker run -it --rm `
  -v "${PWD}/output:/output" `
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key" `
  -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_deepseek_key" `
  agent-laboratory `
  --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" `
  --research-topic "Your research topic here"
```

#### Docker Setup Features

1. **Output Organization**:
   - All outputs are mounted to your local `output` directory
   - `output/research_dir/` contains:
     * `src/` - Generated Python code files
     * `tex/` - LaTeX files
     * `readme.md` - Project documentation
     * `report.txt` - Research report
   - `output/state_saves/` contains checkpoint files for resuming work

2. **Available Options**:
   - `--llm-backend`: Choose between "deepseek-chat" or OpenAI models
   - `--compile-latex`: Set to "false" to disable LaTeX compilation
   - `--copilot-mode`: Set to "true" to enable copilot mode
   - `--load-existing`: Set to "true" to load from a previous state
   - `--load-existing-path`: Specify the state file to load from

#### Example Commands

1. **Using DeepSeek with LaTeX disabled**:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" -e DEEPSEEK_API_KEY="your_key" agent-laboratory --llm-backend "deepseek-chat" --compile-latex "false" --research-topic "Topic"
```

2. **Using OpenAI with copilot mode**:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key" agent-laboratory --llm-backend "o1-mini" --copilot-mode "true" --research-topic "Topic"
```

3. **Loading from previous state**:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)/output:/output" -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key" agent-laboratory --load-existing "true" --load-existing-path "state_saves/results_interpretation.pkl" --research-topic "Topic"
```

#### Important Notes

1. **Directory Mounting**:
   - The `-v` flag mounts your local `output` directory to the container
   - All generated files will be accessible in this directory
   - Make sure the directory exists before running the container

2. **API Keys**:
   - Both OpenAI and DeepSeek keys can be used simultaneously
   - Keys are passed through environment variables for security:
     * `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI models
     * `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` for DeepSeek models
   - Keys are automatically picked up from environment variables, no need to pass them as command line arguments

3. **Model Selection**:
   - DeepSeek: Use `--llm-backend "deepseek-chat"`
   - OpenAI: Use `--llm-backend "o1-mini"` or other available OpenAI models

4. **State Management**:
   - States are automatically saved in `output/state_saves/`
   - Use `--load-existing` and `--load-existing-path` to resume from a saved state
   - States are saved after each phase for recovery

### Python venv option (Alternative)

* We recommend using python 3.12

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: Begin by cloning the repository using the command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:SamuelSchmidgall/AgentLaboratory.git
```

2. **Set up and Activate Python Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv_agent_lab
```
- Now activate this environment:
```bash
source venv_agent_lab/bin/activate
```

```
venv_agent_lab\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. **Install required libraries**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install pdflatex [OPTIONAL]**
```bash
sudo apt install pdflatex
```
- This enables latex source to be compiled by the agents.
- **[IMPORTANT]** If this step cannot be run due to not having sudo access, pdf compiling can be turned off via running Agent Laboratory via setting the `--compile-latex` flag to false: `--compile-latex "false"`



5. **Now run Agent Laboratory!**

`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA"`

or, if you don't have pdflatex installed

`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA" --compile-latex "false"`

### Co-Pilot mode

To run Agent Laboratory in copilot mode, simply set the copilot-mode flag to `"true"`

`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA" --copilot-mode "true"`

## Tips for better research outcomes


#### [Tip #1] üìù Make sure to write extensive notes! üìù

**Writing extensive notes is important** for helping your agent understand what you're looking to accomplish in your project, as well as any style preferences. Notes can include any experiments you want the agents to perform, providing API keys, certain plots or figures you want included, or anything you want the agent to know when performing research.

This is also your opportunity to let the agent know **what compute resources it has access to**, e.g. GPUs (how many, what type of GPU, how many GBs), CPUs (how many cores, what type of CPUs), storage limitations, and hardware specs.

In order to add notes, you must modify the task_notes_LLM structure inside of `ai_lab_repo.py`. Provided below is an example set of notes used for some of our experiments. 


```
task_notes_LLM = [
    {"phases": ["plan formulation"],
     "note": f"You should come up with a plan for TWO experiments."},

    {"phases": ["plan formulation", "data preparation",  "running experiments"],
     "note": "Please use gpt-4o-mini for your experiments."},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": f'Use the following code to inference gpt-4o-mini: \nfrom openai import OpenAI\nos.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "{api_key}"\nclient = OpenAI()\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.create(\nmodel="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18", messages=messages)\nanswer = completion.choices[0].message.content\n'},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": f"You have access to only gpt-4o-mini using the OpenAI API, please use the following key {api_key} but do not use too many inferences. Do not use openai.ChatCompletion.create or any openai==0.28 commands. Instead use the provided inference code."},

    {"phases": ["running experiments"],
     "note": "I would recommend using a small dataset (approximately only 100 data points) to run experiments in order to save time. Do not use much more than this unless you have to or are running the final tests."},

    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "You are running on a MacBook laptop. You can use 'mps' with PyTorch"},

    {"phases": ["data preparation", "running experiments"],
     "note": "Generate figures with very colorful and artistic design."},
    ]
```

#### [Tip #2] üöÄ Using more powerful models generally leads to better research üöÄ

When conducting research, **the choice of model can significantly impact the quality of results**. More powerful models tend to have higher accuracy, better reasoning capabilities, and better report generation. If computational resources allow, prioritize the use of advanced models such as o1-(mini/preview) or similar state-of-the-art large language models.

However, **it‚Äôs important to balance performance and cost-effectiveness**. While powerful models may yield better results, they are often more expensive and time-consuming to run. Consider using them selectively‚Äîfor instance, for key experiments or final analyses‚Äîwhile relying on smaller, more efficient models for iterative tasks or initial prototyping.

When resources are limited, **optimize by fine-tuning smaller models** on your specific dataset or combining pre-trained models with task-specific prompts to achieve the desired balance between performance and computational efficiency.

-----

#### [Tip #3] ‚úÖ You can load previous saves from checkpoints ‚úÖ

**If you lose progress, internet connection, or if a subtask fails, you can always load from a previous state.** All of your progress is saved by default in the `state_saves` variable, which stores each individual checkpoint. Just pass the following arguments when running `ai_lab_repo.py`

`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --load-existing True --load-existing-path "save_states/LOAD_PATH"`

-----



#### [Tip #4] üàØ If you are running in a language other than English üà≤

If you are running Agent Laboratory in a language other than English, no problem, just make sure to provide a language flag to the agents to perform research in your preferred language. Note that we have not extensively studied running Agent Laboratory in other languages, so be sure to report any problems you encounter.

For example, if you are running in Chinese:

`python ai_lab_repo.py --api-key "API_KEY_HERE" --research-topic "YOUR RESEARCH IDEA (in your language)" --llm-backend "o1-mini" --language "‰∏≠Êñá"`
